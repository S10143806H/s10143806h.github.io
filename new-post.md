### <font color="#EF4E0A">Method 2: Dual Language Supporting</font>

![](https://i.imgur.com/REvNkXU.png)
.pot portable object template
.po  portable object files (for translator)
.mo machine object files

---
Step 1.

`pip install sphinx-intl`

---
Step 2. Add configuration to `conf.py`
```
locale_dirs = ['locale/'] #path is example but not recommended.
gettext_compact = False   #optional 
```
---
Step 3. Extract translatable messages into pot files.

`$ make gettext`
* The generated `.pot` files will be placed in the `build/gettext` directory.

---
Step 4. Generate `.po` files
We will use the pot files generated in the above step.

`$ sphinx-intl update -p build/gettext -l zh_CN -l zh_TW`

Once completed, the generated `.po` files will be placed in the below directories:

* `../locale/zh_CN/LC_MESSAGES/`
* `../locale/zh_TW/LC_MESSAGES/`

---
Step 5. Translate `.po` files

---
Step 6 Build translated document

`make -e SPHINXOPTS-" -D language='zh_TW'html`
